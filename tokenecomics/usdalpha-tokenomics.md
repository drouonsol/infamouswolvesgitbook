# $ALPHA Tokenomics

The supply will start at 77,777 and will be minted as people claim the staking rewards. The total supply will be maxed out at 77,777,777 tokens. Each NFT will earn 5 tokens per day. \
The start of the liquidity pool will consist of 40K $HEAD / 30K $USD which means that the initial price of $HEAD is going to be $0.75. We plan on making regular injections.&#x20;

Every day 38,885 tokens get minted and distributed as follows :\
\
70% - Staking \
10% - LP \
7,5% - Available VC \
5% - Team (5 Year Vesting)\
5% - DAO \
2,5% -Giveaways\
\
Halvings : \
For every 15,555,554 Tokens there will be a halving in the reward rate this means that the tokens will be minted and distributed for 12400 Days, 34 Years, or up to 2056 AC\
\
Team Vesting: \
All the funds that get distributed to the team will be locked for 3 years from the day that the tokens are minted which means that the last tokens will be opened for the team in 2060.\
\
LP  \
Liquidity pools will be injected casually, or if the team finds that emergency liquidity is needed.\
The farms will also be opened for holders to provide liquidity after prices have stabilized so investors protect their capital from volitile pools&#x20;
