But behind the clear picture we got to have a clear frame of those are values : \
\
**1. Keepin it real** \
We are here to create something big, create something new, and things like that require more than just great execution they require keeping this shit real. Make sure that every move and the why is known by the community, intentions in a deal, etc. \
\
**2. Improvement for everyone**\
We believe that proving a better quality and UX in the ecosystem benefits everyone, setting the right foundation will make sure that we are staying here for years to come \
\
**3. Power to the people**\
Just like web2 companies.NFT owners own our business through our NFT collection since they have 100% ownership they have 100% power in the decisions\
\
**4. Ambition** \
We believe that the NFT market has huge potential just not in the Ponzi form that it is today. So we are here to make sure that we take NFT to the outside world and everyone knows the Name Degen Heads, Billboards, Companies, Merch, and other Products\
